# LootBot
LootBot is a discord bot in use by The Defiant Coalition, an Everquest guild on the Agnarr server. It's primary purpose is to support the loot council and facilitate quick decision making.  Additionally it includes entertainment and utility functions of use to the guild in general.

Missing from the repository is "secrets.py"  which contains the variable BotToken="<Token from discord>".  This is private authentication information that couldn't be shared publicly.  To run your own copy of LootBot you'll need your own token.

The bot functions rely heavily on the discord.py project, and you'll need to have this to run the code.
